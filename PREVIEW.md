# Pitt Tonight Visual Argument
	
  This project is an attempt to recruit new members to join the student organization Pitt Tonight. Pitt Tonight is a 
  late-night-style talk show that has episodes hosted once a month that include comedy, interviews with guests, and 
  musical performances. I think I am going to have to do a trial and error for my project, because I cannot decide which 
  idea that I like best. I sketched out a few last class (which was very helpful), but I'm having trouble choosing which 
  one would be most logical to execute. My proposal will be different than my final piece as it was for the Soundscape 
  project, but this time around, the preview may also look wildly different if I decide I do not like the current idea.
  The current idea is showing one of the main spaces we use for episodes - the Charity Randall Theater inside the Stephen 
  Foster Memorial building. I used transparency so that text will be more apparent on top of it. My plan is to do a “Day 
  in the Life” style visual that showcases what each department does during day-of show to draw interest to various areas 
  of students. Each bubble will have a picture of a person from each department and will have a caption underneath. It is 
  a very rough outline of what the project will look like because I was struggling a lot to use GIMP. I am having trouble 
  with basic functions like scaling images and moving them, honestly. Hopefully I will get more comfortable with it soon, 
  but I am just very used to Adobe applications like Photoshop and InDesign. I also think I will aim to finish this project 
  by the weekend in case I want to switch the premise entirely because I will definitely need a more tangible idea of what 
  this could end up looking like before deciding if I like it or not.
