## Project Proposal

For my project, I think I want to call attention to an organization on campus that many people do not know exists - Pitt Tonight. It is a late-night talk show that hosts an episode once a month. The episodes are modeled after most late night talk shows currently running, such as Fallon or Kimmel. I want to give a little insight into how funny these episodes are to hopefully attract more audience members for our next episode in March, which is our Women's Empowerment episode. This also shows a little of what this student organization stands for (equal rights), which is an argument in itself.

Potential assets:

- Pitt Tonight logo (definitely using this)

- PGH skyline silhouette

- Female gender symbol

- Some photos from previous episodes
