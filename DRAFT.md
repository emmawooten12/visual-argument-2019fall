## Pitt Tonight Visual Argument 

This project is an attempt to recruit new members to join the student organization Pitt Tonight. Pitt Tonight is a late-night-
style talk show that has episodes hosted once a month that include comedy, interviews with guests, and musical performances. 
I am still doing a trial and error for this project because I still do not think I like the idea. I do not know exactly how to 
insert images into the frames of the clouds seen in the .png, so this rough draft is very incomplete. The images should fit 
nicely into the clouds, but in order to give myself more time to figure out how to use GIMP, I just added the images from the 
show inside each cloud. I added text on the side to urge that if people are interested in the topics written under each bubble,
they should apply to be in the organization.

The current idea is showing one of the main spaces we use for episodes (the Charity Randall Theater inside the Stephen Foster
Memorial building). I used transparency so that text will be more apparent on top of it. Instead of doing a "Day in the Life"
style visual, it is just going to show some of the main things Pitt Tonight offers. It is supposed to send the message that this
show is Fallon-style and draw people's interest. People who are passionate about any of the topics mentioned on the visual will 
hopefully see this and want to know more about what this organization does. I am still super rough on the use of GIMP and very 
far from being a wizard, so hopefully between now and Sunday I will have a better idea of how to execute this project idea.
