My main goal of this piece is to recruit new members to join the student organization Pitt Tonight. Pitt Tonight is a late-night-style talk show that has episodes hosted once a month that include comedy, interviews with guests, and musical performances. My original idea was to do “A Day in the Life,” but it turned out much differently. I struggled greatly with using Gimp and could not execute my project exactly the way I wanted to. After countless attempts, working with the professor, and watching an absurd number of tutorials on YouTube, I barely got the hang of the editing software. As seen in the screenshot below, this is how the project started:

I had the idea to insert pictures into the clouds, and that was going to be much more difficult than I had originally thought. This is what I ended up submitting for the draft:

I was not super proud of what I was putting forth, but until I could figure out what I could do about layering the pictures and the cloud outlines correctly, this was all I could come up with. I was surprised to see that my classmates liked what they saw, and they definitely had some helpful feedback. Here are the three notecards:

Specifically, I would like to highlight the fact that one of the pieces of advice suggested a change in scale of the text. She said that the “Pitt Tonight” focus was not very prominent, which is important to highlight considering that is the main focus of the piece (as seen on the last notecard as well). That notecard also suggested layer groups for each layer group. Furthermore, the next notecard touched on the individual pictures, asking for them to be brighter since they are small and hard to see. I took all of these into consideration when doing my final edit. I knew I had to fix the images, but I did not think of the text changes or layer groups.
I had extreme trouble with the layers, layer masks, and being able to select only part of the image to delete. This was my attempt to fix the piece, but also where I came to a stopping point at the end of class on Thursday.

Finally, once I was able to use the background erase tool, scale the images properly within the clouds, and change the layout, I could mess with the text a little as well. Here is the final outcome:

As for baseline criteria, I do think I hit all aspects pretty well.

I used arrangement, size, and visual rhythm to focus viewers' attention.
- Have a clear message recruiting people to join the organization.
- The font is carefully chosen as well. Bebas Neue Bold is used by the student organization, so it only made sense to stay consistent with normal Pitt Tonight advertisements and flyers.
- The color palette is also purposeful. I used images that are full of color (especially the background), so I chose the text to be white so the piece would not be nearly as dense.
- I 100% used more than 3 layers.
- I used layer masks and the background erase tool a lot, as well as messing with the opacity for the background.

A few aspirational criteria were met as well.
- I used overlapping pictures and sizing to showcase depth (the pictures inside the clouds).
- I figured out how to use folders to group layers.
- I tried to use layer masks for advanced combining of layers.
- I attempted to create the illusion of seamlessness amongst the flyer.
- I used the words ‘scale’ and ‘density’ to analyze this project.
- In the notecards for feedback, you can see that viewers understand the intention of the piece, which is recruiting people to sign up for Pitt Tonight.
